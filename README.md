  I obtained this file from kaggle. This file contains a lot of information from the National Basketball Association from every team and stats from every team and their players even if they move from one team to another. Looking through this data set, I noticed the data set contained many different labels of importance such as team, players, points, rebounds, assists, rebounds, as well as shots attempted such as from 3-point line, free throws, and field goals. In order to have more accurate data I cleaned up the data set by removing any player that was absent because of injury or by the coach's decision. This did not remove the player entirely from the data set but just from the time that he was injured in that team.

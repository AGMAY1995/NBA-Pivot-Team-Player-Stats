File URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games?resource=download&select=ranking.csv

  I obtained this file from kaggle. This file contains much information from the National Basketball Association from every team and stats from every team/player whether they move from one team to another. Looking through this data set, I noticed the data set contained many different labels of importance such as team, players, points, rebounds, assists, rebounds, as well as shots attempted and made from 3-point line, free throws, and field goals.
